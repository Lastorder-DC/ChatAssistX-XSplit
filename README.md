# twitch-chat-viewer-popout
Twitch Chat Viewer plugin based on skinning Twitch's chat popout

This is intended only as a demonstration of the [XSplit JS Framework](http://xjsframework.github.io).

### Instructions for testing

- You may clone the repository and host `index.html`, `index.xml` and `index_config.html` yourself(If you do so, please ensure they are all in the same folder). Add the source via webpage URL.
- Alternatively, you may use https://cdn.rawgit.com/xjsframework/twitch-chat-viewer-popout/0b9ed2fcef95f23eb3b2e5c5bca7c604a5b6a777/index.html (no uptime guarantees as this is a free service.)
